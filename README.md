## :star2: About the Project

Bento is a tool to help manage and organize your frequently used links in a convenient way. It allows you to create lists of links, known as "bentos," which you can access quickly whenever you need them. This makes it easier for you to navigate to your favorite apps, pages, and resources with just a few clicks.
